# Binary Tree Operations in C

This repository contains a collection of C functions for working with binary trees. The functions implemented cover various operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and checking properties like whether the tree is a binary search tree (BST) or an AVL tree.

## Description

The project focuses on implementing and understanding binary trees as data structures in C programming language. It provides functions for creating, manipulating, and analyzing binary trees. The operations include insertion of nodes, deletion of nodes, traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order), checking properties (leaf, root, fullness, balance), and more.

## File Structure

- **Source Files**: Contains individual C files for each function implementation.
- **Header File**: Defines structures and function prototypes.
- **Test Files**: Provides test cases to validate the functionality.
- **Helper File**: A utility function to print binary trees in a visually appealing manner.

## Functions Provided

The project includes functions for the following operations:

- Creation of binary tree nodes.
- Insertion of nodes as left or right children.
- Deletion of entire binary trees.
- Traversal methods: pre-order, in-order, post-order.
- Calculation of height, depth, size, number of leaves, and nodes.
- Checking properties like whether the tree is a root, leaf, full, balanced, perfect, BST, or AVL.
- Finding siblings, uncles, and lowest common ancestor.
- Level-order traversal.
- Rotation operations: left and right.
- Insertion, search, and removal in BST.
- Building BST and AVL trees from arrays.
- Evaluation of time complexities for various operations.
